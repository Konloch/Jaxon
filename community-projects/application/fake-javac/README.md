# Fake-Javac
This is used in the Jaxon-Blank-JDK to make Intellij work with a JDK that contains no classfiles.

# How To Build
+ You can build from Windows, Linux or Mac. Install [Jaxon](https://konloch.com/Jaxon) to compile.
+ **To build a Linux binary** run `Build-Linux`
+ **To build a Windows binary** run `Build-Windows-App` or `Build-Windows-Executable`
	+ Note: 'app' won't have console output

# How To Run
+ Build files will output at `build/windows/build.exe` and `build/linux.build`
+ Run them like you would a normal program `./build`
