# Jaxon Community Projects
This repository is a mono repo containing Jaxon / SJC projects that have been contributed by several members of the Jaxon community. It's meant to act as a single location that contains the modern Jaxon build system.

Whether you're a seasoned SJC developer or just getting started, this repository offers a wealth of resources to help you get the most out of the compiler. From build scripts to custom operating-systems, you'll find a wide variety of projects to explore and contribute to.

Join the Jaxon community today and help us build a brighter future for SJC development!
